Description: control processes execution environment and available resources
 nicy is a script that relies on existing system utilities and can be used
 to ease the control upon the execution environment of the managed processes
 and to configure the resources available to them: with renice, can alter
 their scheduling priority; with chrt, can set their real-time scheduling
 attributes and with ionice their I/O scheduling class and priority; with
 choom, can adjust their Out-Of-Memory killer score setting.
 .
 It can create and start a transient systemd scope unit and either run
 the specified command and its spawned processes in it with systemd-run, or
 move yet running processes inside it.
 .
 When used to launch commands, nicy can also automatically change some
 environment variables and add command arguments.
 .
 The processes are managed by nicy applying them generic or specific presets
 stored in JSON format.
